# Kuhn Poker DREAM Experiments

This repository contains reproducible experiments for evaluating a DREAM-style neural regret-minimisation algorithm on Kuhn poker using DeepMind's OpenSpiel library.

The immediate aim is to establish a thesis-quality DREAM baseline that is aligned with the sister Deep CFR and ESCHER repositories. Kuhn poker is used as the diagnostic environment because it is a small two-player zero-sum imperfect-information game with a known game value and exact exploitability evaluation. The results from this repository are intended to sit alongside the Deep CFR and ESCHER Kuhn poker experiments in an MPhil thesis on neural CFR methods for poker.

The repository is organised so that each experiment can be run independently while sharing reusable DREAM code. The shared `dream_poker` package contains the DREAM-style solver, neural-network definitions, replay buffers, plotting helpers, seeding utilities, and experiment export utilities. Each experiment lives in its own package under `experiments/kuhn_poker/<experiment_name>/`.

> Important note: this is an OpenSpiel DREAM-style implementation designed for comparable thesis experiments. It is not a bit-for-bit port of the official PokerRL DREAM repository.

## Experiments

### 1. Kuhn poker DREAM-style multi-seed baseline

[`experiments/kuhn_poker/dream_multiseed_baseline/`](experiments/kuhn_poker/dream_multiseed_baseline/README.md)

Runs the aligned DREAM-style baseline on OpenSpiel `kuhn_poker` across matched random seeds. The primary metric is exploitability, reported as NashConv divided by two. Secondary metrics include policy-value error from the known Kuhn game value, nodes touched, wall-clock time, and final/best/final-window exploitability. Diagnostic metrics include policy loss, advantage-network loss, learned-baseline loss, replay-buffer sizes, target variance, policy entropy, and gradient norms.

**Question:** under a fixed training protocol, does the DREAM-style implementation learn a low-exploitability average policy in Kuhn poker, and how variable is the result across random seeds?

Future DREAM ablations should be added as separate experiment folders under `experiments/kuhn_poker/`, while reusing the shared `dream_poker` package.

## Setup

Create and activate a virtual environment. The repository contains a placeholder `venv/` directory, but the actual environment is not committed.

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate       # macOS/Linux
# .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1   # Windows PowerShell
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

OpenSpiel installation can vary by platform. If `pip install -r requirements.txt` fails on `open_spiel`, install OpenSpiel following the official instructions for your platform.

## Running the experiments

From the repository root:

```bash
# Experiment 1 — full aligned DREAM-style baseline
python -m experiments.kuhn_poker.dream_multiseed_baseline.run
```

For a quick smoke test:

```bash
python -m experiments.kuhn_poker.dream_multiseed_baseline.run       --seeds 1234,2025       --iterations 10       --traversals 50       --policy-network-train-steps 20       --advantage-network-train-steps 20       --baseline-network-train-steps 20       --evaluation-interval 5       --output-root outputs/smoke_tests/dream_multiseed_baseline
```

Outputs are written to a timestamped subdirectory under `outputs/` by default. The key files are:

```text
seed_summary.csv
aggregate_summary.json
checkpoint_curves.csv
experiment_metadata.json
exploitability_by_iteration_multiseed.png
exploitability_by_nodes_multiseed.png
policy_value_error_multiseed.png
policy_loss_diagnostic.png
advantage_target_variance_diagnostic.png
baseline_reward_variance_diagnostic.png
summary_metrics.png
```

## Notes for adding future experiments

When adding a new DREAM experiment, follow the same pattern as the baseline:

1. create a new folder under `experiments/kuhn_poker/`;
2. include a `config.py`, `run.py`, and `README.md`;
3. hold the baseline protocol fixed except for the intended treatment variable;
4. use matched seeds where possible;
5. export the same core metrics and plots so the thesis results have a consistent look and feel.
